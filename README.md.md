### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I took this Frontend Mentor challenge to refresh the concepts I learned a while ago. Although I've built several landing pages in the past, this was a great opportunity to brush up on my skills after a long break.

The key thing I focused on was maintaining consistent units, which is essential for building responsive websites. I also used media queries—something I'm already familiar with—but this time I faced a bit of confusion, which helped me understand them even better.


### Continued development

I plan to use the concepts from this challenge—like responsive layout techniques, Flexbox, and consistent unit usage—in future projects. This QR code card layout will also serve as a reference when building reusable card components or designing mobile-first interfaces.
